Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed architectural summary of the Spring PetClinic application and wants a component overview table. First, I need to parse through the summary to identify each component, their responsibilities, interfaces, dependencies, and technologies used. 

Starting with the core components mentioned in the summary, I see sections on Web Frontend Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, Test Infrastructure, etc. Each of these can be a component. For example, the Web Frontend Layer includes Thymeleaf Templates and SCSS Styling System. I should split those into separate components if they serve different purposes or have distinct interfaces.

Next, the API Endpoints and Database Schema are also important. The API endpoints like /owners, /vets, etc., might be part of the Owners Service or Vets Service. The repositories and database models belong to the Data Access Layer, which interacts with the database.

Looking at dependencies, each service (like Owners, Vets) depends on other components such as repositories, validators, and formatters. For example, the Pet Validator depends on the Pet Repository. The technologies listed include Spring Boot, JPA, H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Patterns like Repository Pattern, Caching with Caffeine, and Layered Architecture should be noted.

I also need to check the Deployment Details section, where Docker and Kubernetes are mentioned. Those might be part of the Infrastructure/Deployment component.

Let me list out possible components based on the information:

1. **Web Frontend Layer**: Thymeleaf Templates, SCSS Styling System, Web Configuration.
2. **Pet Clinics Owners Service**: Handles owner, pet, and visit operations.
3. **Pet Clinics Vets Service**: Manages vets and specialties.
4. **Business Logic Layer**: Includes validators like PetValidator, OwnerValidator, and formatters.
5. **Data Access Layer**: Repositories for entities and caching mechanisms.
6. **Test Infrastructure**: Integration tests using Testcontainers and unit tests.
7. **Shared Infrastructure**: Internationalization, error handling components.
8. **Database-as-Service**: Handles different database configurations.
9. **Microservice Communication**: API Gateway and event-driven communication.
10. **Deployment Infrastructure**: Docker and Kubernetes deployments.

Now, for each component, I'll need to outline their responsibilities, key endpoints or methods, dependencies, and the technologies used. Ensuring that each component is distinct and covers all necessary aspects from the summary. Also, checking that dependencies and technologies are correctly attributed.

For example, the Owners Service would depend on theOwners Repository and Pet Validator. Its interfaces would include the API endpoints for owners, like GET /owners. Technologies would include Spring Boot, JPA, and the databases listed.

I need to make sure that there are no overlaps between components, and each part is logically grouped. Also, the interfaces (endpoints) should be aligned with the respective services. Finally, the technologies and patterns should be accurately captured based on the summary provided.
