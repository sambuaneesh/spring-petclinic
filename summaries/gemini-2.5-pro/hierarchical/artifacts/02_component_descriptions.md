| Component Name | Responsibility | Interfaces (key endpoints or methods) | Depends On (other modules) | Technologies (frameworks, DBs, patterns) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Application Core** | Bootstraps the Spring Boot application, configures runtime hints for AOT/native image optimization, and orchestrates end-to-end integration testing. | `PetClinicApplication.main()`, REST API endpoints tested via `*IntegrationTests` (e.g., `/owners/{ownerId}`) | Owner & Pet Management, Veterinarian Management, System & Cross-Cutting Concerns | Spring Boot, Testcontainers, JUnit 5, AOT Compilation, Spring Profiles |
| **Domain Model** | Defines the foundational, reusable domain entities and their common attributes (`id`, `name`) and validation rules. Establishes the core data structure blueprint. | `BaseEntity`, `Person`, `NamedEntity` (abstract base classes) | None (Foundational) | JPA (`@MappedSuperclass`), Bean Validation (JSR-303), Object-Oriented Design (Inheritance), Domain-Driven Design (DDD) |
| **Owner & Pet Management** | Manages the complete lifecycle of pet owners, their pets, and associated medical visits. Handles registration, search, updates, and data validation. | `OwnerController` (`/owners/*`), `PetController` (`/owners/{ownerId}/pets/*`), `VisitController` (`/owners/.../visits/*`), `OwnerRepository` | Domain Model | Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Server-Side Validation, Repository Pattern, MVC Pattern |
| **Veterinarian Management**| Manages veterinarian profiles, including their medical specialties. Provides functionality to list vets for both web UI and RESTful API consumers. | `VetController` (`/vets`, `/vets.json`, `/vets.xml`), `VetRepository` | Domain Model | Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Caching (`@Cacheable`), JAXB, DTO Pattern (`Vets` wrapper), Repository Pattern |
| **Service Layer & Logic Validation** | Orchestrates business logic, applies domain rules, and validates the transactional integrity and correct interaction of the data persistence layer for all domain entities. | `ClinicService` (validated by `ClinicServiceTests`), `EntityUtils` helper methods | Domain Model, Owner & Pet Management (Repositories), Veterinarian Management (Repositories) | Spring Framework (Core), Spring Data JPA, JUnit 5, Service Layer Pattern, Utility Class Pattern |
| **System & Cross-Cutting Concerns** | Manages application-wide infrastructure and non-functional requirements, including caching, internationalization (i18n), global error handling, and the main web entry point. | `WelcomeController` (`/`), `CrashController` (`/oups`), `CacheConfiguration`, `WebConfiguration` | Provides services to all other web-facing components | Spring Boot (`@Configuration`), Spring Caching (JCache), Spring MVC (`LocaleChangeInterceptor`), Global Exception Handling |
