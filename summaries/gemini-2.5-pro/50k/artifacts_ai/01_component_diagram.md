The architecture depicts a classic monolithic application with components structured around business domains (Owner, Veterinarian) and system concerns, all sharing a common persistence layer. Communication is primarily synchronous HTTP from the client, leading to in-process method calls from controllers to repository interfaces within the monolith, with the Vet component leveraging a cache-aside pattern to optimize database access.
