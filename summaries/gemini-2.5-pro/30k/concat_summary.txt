=== summary_chunk_1.txt ===

An architectural summary of the Spring PetClinic codebase (Part 1 of 3) is provided below, focusing on details relevant to microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Overall Architecture Summary

The Spring PetClinic application is a **monolithic web application** built using the **Spring Boot** framework. Its primary purpose is to model the operations of a veterinary clinic, managing pet owners, their pets, medical visits, and veterinarian staff.

-   **Architectural Pattern**: A classic **Layered Monolithic Architecture**. The code is organized by feature into packages (`owner`, `vet`), but all features are deployed as a single unit. It uses a traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for web interactions.
-   **Technology Stack**:
    -   **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA (with Hibernate).
    -   **Frontend**: Thymeleaf for server-side template rendering, with Bootstrap and Font-Awesome for styling.
    -   **Database**: In-memory H2 by default, with profile-based support for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
    -   **Build**: Apache Maven and Gradle are supported.
-   **Communication Style**: All communication is intra-process method calls. There are no network calls between internal components.

---

### 2. Component Breakdown

The application is logically divided into three primary modules/components based on its package structure: **Owner Management**, **Veterinarian Management**, and **System/Cross-Cutting Concerns**.

#### 2.1 Component: Owner Management (`owner` package)

This component is responsible for all functionality related to pet owners and their animals, including pets, visits, and pet types. This is the most complex component and a prime candidate for a microservice.

**Responsibilities:**
-   Managing owner information (create, read, update, find).
-   Managing pet information for each owner.
-   Managing medical visit records for each pet.
-   Managing the list of available pet types.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**
The application provides a traditional web UI, not a REST API. The endpoints map to user actions.

| Class               | HTTP Method | Path                                          | Responsibility                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/find`                                | Display owner search form.                     |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners`                                     | Process owner search by last name (paginated). |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/new`                                 | Display new owner creation form.               |
| `OwnerController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/new`                                 | Process creation of a new owner.               |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}`                           | Display details for a specific owner.          |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/edit`                      | Display owner update form.                     |
| `OwnerController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/edit`                      | Process owner update.                          |
| `PetController`     | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`                  | Display new pet form for an owner.             |
| `PetController`     | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`                  | Process creation of a new pet.                 |
| `PetController`     | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit`         | Display pet update form.                       |
| `PetController`     | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit`         | Process pet update.                            |
| `VisitController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`   | Display new visit form for a pet.              |
| `VisitController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`   | Process creation of a new visit.               |

**Database Schemas and Data Models:**
This component owns the following JPA entities, which map to the database schema below.

-   **`Owner` (Entity)**: Extends `Person`. Represents a pet owner.
    -   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `address`, `city`, `telephone`.
    -   Relationships: `@OneToMany` with `Pet` (composition, an Owner has Pets).
-   **`Pet` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents an animal.
    -   Fields: `id`, `name`, `birthDate`.
    -   Relationships: `@ManyToOne` with `PetType`, `@OneToMany` with `Visit`. Belongs to an `Owner`.
-   **`PetType` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents pet categories (e.g., cat, dog).
    -   Fields: `id`, `name`.
-   **`Visit` (Entity)**: Extends `BaseEntity`. Represents a medical visit.
    -   Fields: `id`, `date`, `description`.
    -   Relationships: Belongs to a `Pet`.

**Database Tables:**
-   `owners`: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, `city`, `telephone`.
-   `pets`: `id`, `name`, `birth_date`, `type_id` (FK to `types`), `owner_id` (FK to `owners`).
-   `visits`: `id`, `pet_id` (FK to `pets`), `visit_date`, `description`.
-   `types`: `id`, `name`.

**Service Dependencies and Communication:**
-   `OwnerController`, `PetController`, `VisitController` all depend on `OwnerRepository` to fetch and persist data.
-   `PetController` also depends on `PetTypeRepository` to populate pet type dropdowns.
-   `PetTypeFormatter` is a Spring `Formatter` used by the MVC framework to bind `PetType` objects in web forms.

**Key Business Logic and Algorithms:**
-   **Owner Search**: `OwnerController` implements a paginated search for owners by last name.
-   **Pet Validation**: `PetValidator` contains custom validation logic for `Pet` entities (e.g., name is required, birth date is not in the future).
-   **Duplicate Pet Name Check**: `PetController` prevents an owner from having two pets with the same name.
-   **Data Integrity**: Data consistency is managed via JPA relationships and cascading operations (`CascadeType.ALL` on `Owner` -> `Pet` and `Pet` -> `Visit`), ensuring that when an owner is saved, their associated pets and visits are also saved.

---

#### 2.2 Component: Veterinarian Management (`vet` package)

This component handles information about veterinarians and their specialties. It is largely a read-only component from the UI perspective.

**Responsibilities:**
-   Listing all veterinarians and their specialties.
-   Providing veterinarian data in HTML, JSON, and XML formats.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**

| Class           | HTTP Method | Path          | Responsibility                                          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VetController` | `GET`       | `/vets.html`  | Display a list of all vets (HTML view).                 |
| `VetController` | `GET`       | `/vets`       | Return a list of all vets as JSON or XML (data endpoint). |

**Database Schemas and Data Models:**

-   **`Vet` (Entity)**: Extends `Person`. Represents a veterinarian.
    -   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`.
    -   Relationships: `@ManyToMany` with `Specialty` (eagerly fetched).
-   **`Specialty` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents a vet's area of expertise.
    -   Fields: `id`, `name`.
-   **`Vets` (Wrapper Class)**: A JAXB-annotated class used to wrap a list of `Vet` objects for XML/JSON serialization.

**Database Tables:**
-   `vets`: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`.
-   `specialties`: `id`, `name`.
-   `vet_specialties`: A join table with `vet_id` and `specialty_id` to manage the many-to-many relationship.

**Service Dependencies and Communication:**
-   `VetController` depends on `VetRepository` to fetch all vet data.
-   The `/vets` endpoint is cached.

**Key Business Logic and Algorithms:**
-   **Vet Listing with Caching**: The list of vets is cached to improve performance, as configured in `CacheConfiguration`. This suggests vet data is relatively static.

---

#### 2.3 Component: System & Cross-Cutting Concerns (`system` package)

This component contains shared configuration and controllers that are not tied to a specific business domain.

**Responsibilities:**
-   Application-wide configuration (caching, web settings).
-   Serving the welcome page.
-   Handling application errors.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**

| Class               | HTTP Method | Path   | Responsibility                            |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `WelcomeController` | `GET`       | `/`    | Display the application's home/welcome page. |
| `CrashController`   | `GET`       | `/oups`| Intentionally throws an exception for testing error handling. |

**Key Configuration:**
-   **`CacheConfiguration`**: Enables Spring's caching (`@EnableCaching`) and configures a JCache-compliant cache named `"vets"`. This directly impacts the `Vet` component.
-   **`WebConfiguration`**: Configures internationalization (i18n) by setting up a `SessionLocaleResolver` and a `LocaleChangeInterceptor`, allowing users to change the language via a `?lang=` URL parameter.
-   **`PetClinicRuntimeHints`**: Provides hints to the GraalVM AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiler for building a native image, specifying resources to include (e.g., `db/*`, `messages/*`).

---

### 3. Configuration and Deployment Details

**Configuration:**
-   **`application.properties`**: Contains the default configuration. Configures an in-memory H2 database, Thymeleaf settings, and server properties.
-   **`application-mysql.properties` / `application-postgres.properties`**: Provide database connection details for MySQL and PostgreSQL respectively. These are activated using Spring Profiles (`spring.profiles.active=mysql` or `postgres`).
-   **`messages/*.properties`**: Contains internationalization strings for various languages.

**Deployment:**
-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Provides a convenient way to run `mysql` and `postgres` database containers for local development. It maps local ports and sets up the necessary users and databases.
-   **Kubernetes (`k8s/` directory)**: Contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application and a PostgreSQL database.
    -   **`db.yml`**: Defines a `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Secret` for a PostgreSQL database.
    -   **`petclinic.yml`**: Defines a `Deployment` and `Service` (`NodePort` type) for the PetClinic application itself. It demonstrates how to connect to the database using service discovery and projected volumes for secrets, following service binding specifications. It also includes configuration for liveness and readiness probes (`/livez`, `/readyz`), which are enabled via the Actuator.
-   **Build Image**: The `README.md` and `pom.xml` indicate support for building a container image directly via the Spring Boot Maven plugin (`./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`), which uses Cloud Native Buildpacks. There is no explicit `Dockerfile`.

=== summary_chunk_2.txt ===

This document provides a comprehensive architectural summary of the provided codebase chunk (Part 2 of 3), structured for microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Architectural Patterns and Frameworks

*   **Primary Framework:** [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is used for application setup, configuration, and execution.
*   **Architectural Style:** The application follows a traditional monolithic, multi-layered architecture (Web-Controller, Repository-Data Access).
*   **Web Layer:** [Spring MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc.html) is used to handle web requests.
    *   **Templating Engine:** [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) is used for server-side rendering of HTML views.
*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   **ORM:** [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) with [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) as the provider.
    *   **API:** Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@ManyToMany`, etc.) are used for object-relational mapping.
*   **Data Serialization:** [JAXB](https://javaee.github.io/jaxb-v2/) annotations (`@XmlRootElement`, `@XmlElement`) are present, indicating support for XML marshalling in addition to the default JSON provided by Spring Boot.
*   **Caching:** [Spring Cache](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/cache.html) abstraction is used for caching database queries (`@Cacheable`).
*   **Configuration:** Profile-based configuration using `.properties` files (`application-<profile>.properties`).
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Frameworks:** JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ.
    *   **Integration Testing:** [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) is used to run integration tests against real MySQL and PostgreSQL databases in Docker containers.

---

### 2. Component Breakdown

This codebase chunk primarily focuses on the **Veterinarian (Vet) domain** and general system components.

#### 2.1. System Components

*   **`WelcomeController`**
    *   **Responsibility:** Handles requests to the application's root URL, displaying the welcome/home page.
    *   **Location:** `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.system`

#### 2.2. Veterinarian (Vet) Domain Components

*   **`VetController`**
    *   **Responsibility:** Exposes web and API endpoints for retrieving veterinarian information. It handles both HTML view rendering (with pagination) and data-only (JSON/XML) responses.
    *   **Dependencies:** `VetRepository`.

*   **`VetRepository` (Interface)**
    *   **Responsibility:** Defines the data access contract for `Vet` entities. It leverages Spring Data to provide implementations for finding vets.
    *   **Key Features:** Uses Spring's `@Cacheable("vets")` annotation, indicating that results from `findAll()` methods are cached to improve performance and reduce database load.

*   **`Vet` (JPA Entity)**
    *   **Responsibility:** The core data model for a veterinarian. It extends the `Person` class (defined in another chunk).
    *   **Relationships:** Contains a many-to-many relationship with the `Specialty` entity.

*   **`Specialty` (JPA Entity)**
    *   **Responsibility:** Data model for a vet's specialty (e.g., radiology, surgery). It extends the `NamedEntity` class (defined in another chunk).

*   **`Vets` (DTO/Wrapper)**
    *   **Responsibility:** A wrapper object for a `List<Vet>`. Its primary purpose is to simplify marshalling the list into a root XML element (e.g., `<vets>...</vets>`).

---

### 3. API Endpoints and UI Interfaces

*   **`GET /`**
    *   **Controller:** `WelcomeController`
    *   **Responsibility:** Displays the welcome page.
    *   **Returns:** HTML view (`welcome.html`).

*   **`GET /vets.html`**
    *   **Controller:** `VetController`
    *   **Responsibility:** Displays a paginated list of all veterinarians and their specialties.
    *   **Request Parameters:** `?page=<number>` (optional, defaults to 1).
    *   **Returns:** HTML view (`vets/vetList.html`).

*   **`GET /vets`**
    *   **Controller:** `VetController`
    *   **Responsibility:** Provides a machine-readable list of all veterinarians.
    *   **Returns:** JSON or XML response containing a list of all vets, wrapped in a `Vets` object.

---

### 4. Database Schema and Data Models

The database schema is defined in SQL scripts and mapped to Java classes via JPA. The scripts support H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

*   **Table: `vets`**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores veterinarian records.
    *   **Columns:** `id` (PK), `first_name`, `last_name`.
    *   **JPA Entity:** `Vet.java` (extends `Person`).

*   **Table: `specialties`**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores veterinarian specialties.
    *   **Columns:** `id` (PK), `name`.
    *   **JPA Entity:** `Specialty.java` (extends `NamedEntity`).

*   **Table: `vet_specialties` (Join Table)**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages the many-to-many relationship between `vets` and `specialties`.
    *   **Columns:** `vet_id` (FK to `vets.id`), `specialty_id` (FK to `specialties.id`).
    *   **JPA Mapping:** Defined in `Vet.java` using `@ManyToMany` and `@JoinTable`. The fetch strategy is `FetchType.EAGER`.

*   **Other Tables (Defined in schema files, providing context for the whole application):**
    *   `owners`: Stores pet owner information.
    *   `types`: Stores types of pets (e.g., cat, dog).
    *   `pets`: Stores individual pet information with relationships to `owners` and `types`.
    *   `visits`: Stores records of pet visits to the clinic, related to `pets`.

---

### 5. Service Dependencies and Communication

*   **Internal Communication:**
    *   The `VetController` has a compile-time dependency on the `VetRepository`. Communication is via standard Java method calls within the same process.
    *   This is a synchronous, tightly-coupled interaction facilitated by Spring's Dependency Injection.

*   **External Communication:**
    *   The primary external dependency is the **relational database**.
    *   The `VetRepository` communicates with the database via JDBC, managed by the Spring Data JPA framework.

---

### 6. Key Business Logic and Algorithms

*   **Pagination:** The `VetController` implements pagination for the `/vets.html` endpoint. It uses `PageRequest.of(page - 1, pageSize)` to create a `Pageable` object for the repository query.
*   **Data Caching:** The `VetRepository` caches the results of `findAll()` queries in a cache named `"vets"`. Subsequent calls for the full vet list will be served from the cache, avoiding a database trip. This implies that vet data is considered relatively static.
*   **Data Sorting:** In the `Vet` entity, the `getSpecialties()` method sorts the associated specialties alphabetically by name before returning them.
*   **Data Aggregation:** The `Vets` wrapper class is used to aggregate a list of `Vet` objects into a single root object for easier API consumption, particularly for XML clients.

---

### 7. Configuration and Deployment

*   **Database Support:** The application is configured to run with multiple databases (H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) through Spring Profiles.
    *   The active profile is selected via the `database` property in `application.properties` or by setting the `spring.profiles.active` property.
    *   Database connection details (`url`, `username`, `password`) are specified in profile-specific properties files (e.g., `application-mysql.properties`) and can be overridden by environment variables (e.g., `${MYSQL_URL}`).

*   **Database Initialization:**
    *   Schema creation (`schema.sql`) and data seeding (`data.sql`) are handled by Spring Boot's `spring.sql.init` mechanism.
    *   Scripts are idempotent (re-runnable without causing errors), using commands like `INSERT IGNORE` (MySQL) or `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (PostgreSQL).
    *   JPA/Hibernate's `ddl-auto` is explicitly set to `none`, giving full schema control to the SQL scripts.

*   **Actuator:** All Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are exposed (`management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`), providing operational information (health, metrics, etc.) over HTTP.

*   **Internationalization (i18n):** The application is internationalized, with message bundles (`messages_*.properties`) for English, German, Spanish, and several other languages.

*   **Testing & Deployment Pipeline:**
    *   The use of Testcontainers indicates a robust testing strategy that validates application behavior against real database systems, which is crucial for deployment confidence.
    *   The mention of `docker-compose.yml` in documentation files suggests that Docker is a recommended way to run dependent services like databases for local development and possibly deployment.

=== summary_chunk_3.txt ===

An architectural summary of the provided codebase chunk (Part 3 of 3) is detailed below, focusing on information critical for microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Component Names and Their Responsibilities

This chunk primarily consists of test files and configuration, which illuminate the responsibilities of the application's core components.

*   **VisitController:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages UI and logic for adding new visits for a pet. It handles displaying the creation form and processing the form submission.
    *   **File:** `VisitControllerTests.java`

*   **VetController:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Provides information about veterinarians (Vets). It supports both HTML views for web browsers and a JSON API for other clients.
    *   **File:** `VetControllerTests.java`

*   **CrashController:**
    *   **Responsibility:** A system-level utility controller designed to intentionally throw exceptions. This is used to test and demonstrate the application's custom error handling mechanism.
    *   **Files:** `CrashControllerTests.java`, `CrashControllerIntegrationTests.java`

*   **Repository Layer (Inferred from `ClinicServiceTests.java`):**
    *   **OwnerRepository:** Manages persistence for `Owner`, `Pet`, and `Visit` entities. Its methods handle finding, saving, and updating owner-related data, including their pets and visits.
    *   **PetTypeRepository:** Manages persistence for `PetType` entities (e.g., dog, cat).
    *   **VetRepository:** Manages persistence for `Vet` and `Specialty` entities.

*   **EntityUtils:**
    *   **Responsibility:** A test utility class for searching collections of `BaseEntity` objects in-memory by ID.
    *   **File:** `EntityUtils.java`

*   **Quality & CI/CD Components:**
    *   **I18nPropertiesSyncTest:** A test that acts as a quality gate, enforcing internationalization (i18n) by checking for hardcoded strings and ensuring translation files are synchronized.
    *   **JMeter Test Plan:** Defines a performance test suite that simulates user traffic against key application workflows, revealing critical business flows.
    *   **GitHub Actions Workflows:** Automate the build, test, and deployment processes, defining the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Devcontainer Configuration:** Defines a standardized, containerized development environment.

### 2. API Endpoints and Interfaces

The tests and JMeter plan reveal a web application with both UI-facing HTML endpoints and data-oriented JSON endpoints.

*   **Visit Management (Owner-centric):**
    *   `GET /owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`: Displays the HTML form to add a new visit for a specific pet.
    *   `POST /owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`: Processes the creation of a new visit. Redirects to the owner detail page on success.

*   **Vet Management:**
    *   `GET /vets.html`: Returns an HTML page listing all veterinarians, supports pagination (e.g., `?page=1`).
    *   `GET /vets`: Returns a `application/json` response containing a list of all veterinarians and their specialties.

*   **Owner/Pet Management (from JMeter plan):**
    *   `GET /owners/find`: Displays the HTML form to find an owner.
    *   `GET /owners?lastName={name}`: Processes the owner search.
    *   `GET /owners/{ownerId}`: Displays the HTML details for a specific owner.
    *   `GET /owners/{ownerId}/edit`: Displays the HTML form to edit an owner.
    *   `POST /owners/{ownerId}/edit`: Processes an owner update.
    *   `GET /owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`: Displays the HTML form to add a new pet for an owner.
    *   `POST /owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`: Processes the creation of a new pet.

*   **System/Error Handling:**
    *   `GET /oups`: An endpoint that intentionally triggers an exception to test error handling. Returns either an HTML error page or a JSON error response based on the `Accept` header.

### 3. Database Schemas and Data Models

Integration tests in `ClinicServiceTests.java` provide deep insight into the data model and relationships.

*   **Owner:**
    *   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `address`, `city`, `telephone`.
    *   Relationships: One-to-Many with `Pet`. An `Owner` can have multiple `Pet`s.

*   **Pet:**
    *   Fields: `id`, `name`, `birthDate`.
    *   Relationships:
        *   Many-to-One with `Owner`.
        *   Many-to-One with `PetType`.
        *   One-to-Many with `Visit`. A `Pet` can have multiple `Visit`s.

*   **Visit:**
    *   Fields: `id`, `date`, `description`.
    *   Relationships: Many-to-One with `Pet`.

*   **PetType:**
    *   Fields: `id`, `name` (e.g., "cat", "dog", "snake").
    *   Relationships: One-to-Many with `Pet`.

*   **Vet:**
    *   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`.
    *   Relationships: Many-to-Many with `Specialty`. A `Vet` can have multiple `Specialty`s.

*   **Specialty:**
    *   Fields: `id`, `name` (e.g., "radiology", "dentistry").
    *   Relationships: Many-to-Many with `Vet`.

*   **Persistence Behavior:**
    *   The `ClinicServiceTests.java` demonstrates that operations are transactional (`@Transactional`).
    *   The ORM (JPA/Hibernate) handles cascading saves. For instance, saving an `Owner` object that has a new `Pet` added to its collection will persist both the `Owner` and the `Pet`.

### 4. Service Dependencies and Communication Patterns

*   **Internal Dependencies:**
    *   `VisitController` depends on `OwnerRepository` to fetch pet and owner context before adding a visit.
    *   `VetController` depends on `VetRepository` to fetch vet data.
    *   The logic for adding a `Pet` or a `Visit` is orchestrated through the `Owner` aggregate root and persisted via `OwnerRepository`. This indicates a tight coupling between Owner, Pet, and Visit entities.
    *   Vet and Specialty information appears to be a separate domain concern from Owners/Pets/Visits. There are no test cases showing direct interaction between them.

*   **Communication:**
    *   The application follows a classic monolithic, synchronous request-response pattern.
    *   Communication is mediated through Spring MVC controllers, which interact with Spring Data JPA repositories.
    *   There is no evidence of inter-service communication, messaging queues, or asynchronous patterns.

### 5. Key Business Logic and Algorithms

*   **Owner Search:** The application supports paginated searching for owners by last name (`findByLastNameStartingWith`).
*   **Data Validation:** The `VisitControllerTests` show that server-side validation is performed on form submissions (e.g., a `Visit` must have a description).
*   **Entity Management:**
    *   Owners can be created, read, updated.
    *   Pets can be added and updated within the context of an Owner.
    *   Visits can be added within the context of a Pet.
*   **Internationalization (I18n):** The `I18nPropertiesSyncTest` enforces a strict policy that UI strings must be externalized into `.properties` files for translation, indicating that multi-language support is a core requirement.
*   **Error Handling:** The application has a global, custom error handling mechanism that provides user-friendly error pages for UI requests and structured JSON error responses for API requests.

### 6. Configuration and Deployment Details

*   **Build System:** The project is configured to be built with either **Maven** (using `mvnw`) or **Gradle** (using `gradlew`), providing flexibility for developers. The Maven wrapper is configured to use Maven `3.9.10`.
*   **Development Environment:** A `.devcontainer` configuration is provided for a consistent development environment using VS Code Dev Containers or Gitpod. It specifies:
    *   Java version: 21 (or 17 in the Dockerfile).
    *   Tools: Azure CLI, Docker, GitHub CLI.
    *   VS Code extensions for Java development.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
    *   **Build & Test:** Workflows (`maven-build.yml`, `gradle-build.yml`) are triggered on every push/pull request to the `main` branch to build the application and run tests using JDK 17.
    *   **Deployment:** The `deploy-and-test-cluster.yml` workflow defines a Kubernetes deployment strategy.
        *   It creates a `kind` (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster.
        *   It applies Kubernetes manifest files located in the `k8s/` directory.
        *   It expects two primary deployments: the `petclinic` application pod and a `demo-db` database pod. This confirms a containerized deployment model.
*   **Performance Testing:** A JMeter test plan (`petclinic_test_plan.jmx`) is included for load testing. It's configured for 500 concurrent users against a local instance (`localhost:8080`), targeting key business workflows.

### 7. Architectural Patterns and Frameworks

*   **Architectural Style:** Monolithic Web Application. All functionality is packaged and deployed as a single unit.
*   **Core Frameworks:**
    *   **Spring Boot:** Used as the main application framework.
    *   **Spring MVC:** For handling web requests and building both UI (HTML) and API (JSON) endpoints.
    *   **Spring Data JPA:** For database interaction and repository patterns.
*   **Design Patterns:**
    *   **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Clearly separates concerns between controllers, views (Thymeleaf, as seen in previous chunks), and the model (JPA entities).
    *   **Repository Pattern:** Used for data access abstraction (`OwnerRepository`, `VetRepository`).
    *   **Aggregate (Domain-Driven Design concept):** The `Owner` entity acts as an aggregate root for `Pet` and `Visit`. Modifications to pets and visits are managed through the `Owner` and persisted via the `OwnerRepository`. This is a strong indicator of a bounded context.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** (`CrashControllerTests`)
    *   **MVC Slice Tests:** (`@WebMvcTest` in `VisitControllerTests`, `VetControllerTests`) for testing the web layer in isolation with mocked dependencies.
    *   **Data/JPA Slice Tests:** (`@DataJpaTest` in `ClinicServiceTests`) for testing the persistence layer against a real or in-memory database.
    *   **Integration Tests:** (`@SpringBootTest` in `CrashControllerIntegrationTests`) for testing the full application stack.
    *   **Performance Tests:** Using JMeter.
