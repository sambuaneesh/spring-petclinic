An architectural summary of the Spring PetClinic codebase (Part 1 of 3) is provided below, focusing on details relevant to microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Overall Architecture Summary

The Spring PetClinic application is a **monolithic web application** built using the **Spring Boot** framework. Its primary purpose is to model the operations of a veterinary clinic, managing pet owners, their pets, medical visits, and veterinarian staff.

-   **Architectural Pattern**: A classic **Layered Monolithic Architecture**. The code is organized by feature into packages (`owner`, `vet`), but all features are deployed as a single unit. It uses a traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for web interactions.
-   **Technology Stack**:
    -   **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA (with Hibernate).
    -   **Frontend**: Thymeleaf for server-side template rendering, with Bootstrap and Font-Awesome for styling.
    -   **Database**: In-memory H2 by default, with profile-based support for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
    -   **Build**: Apache Maven and Gradle are supported.
-   **Communication Style**: All communication is intra-process method calls. There are no network calls between internal components.

### 2. Component Breakdown

The application is logically divided into three primary modules/components based on its package structure: **Owner Management**, **Veterinarian Management**, and **System/Cross-Cutting Concerns**.

#### 2.1 Component: Owner Management (`owner` package)

This component is responsible for all functionality related to pet owners and their animals, including pets, visits, and pet types. This is the most complex component and a prime candidate for a microservice.

**Responsibilities:**
-   Managing owner information (create, read, update, find).
-   Managing pet information for each owner.
-   Managing medical visit records for each pet.
-   Managing the list of available pet types.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**
The application provides a traditional web UI, not a REST API. The endpoints map to user actions.

| Class               | HTTP Method | Path                                          | Responsibility                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/find`                                | Display owner search form.                     |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners`                                     | Process owner search by last name (paginated). |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/new`                                 | Display new owner creation form.               |
| `OwnerController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/new`                                 | Process creation of a new owner.               |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}`                           | Display details for a specific owner.          |
| `OwnerController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/edit`                      | Display owner update form.                     |
| `OwnerController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/edit`                      | Process owner update.                          |
| `PetController`     | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`                  | Display new pet form for an owner.             |
| `PetController`     | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`                  | Process creation of a new pet.                 |
| `PetController`     | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit`         | Display pet update form.                       |
| `PetController`     | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit`         | Process pet update.                            |
| `VisitController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`   | Display new visit form for a pet.              |
| `VisitController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`   | Process creation of a new visit.               |

**Database Schemas and Data Models:**
This component owns the following JPA entities, which map to the database schema below.

-   **`Owner` (Entity)**: Extends `Person`. Represents a pet owner.
    -   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `address`, `city`, `telephone`.
    -   Relationships: `@OneToMany` with `Pet` (composition, an Owner has Pets).
-   **`Pet` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents an animal.
    -   Fields: `id`, `name`, `birthDate`.
    -   Relationships: `@ManyToOne` with `PetType`, `@OneToMany` with `Visit`. Belongs to an `Owner`.
-   **`PetType` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents pet categories (e.g., cat, dog).
    -   Fields: `id`, `name`.
-   **`Visit` (Entity)**: Extends `BaseEntity`. Represents a medical visit.
    -   Fields: `id`, `date`, `description`.
    -   Relationships: Belongs to a `Pet`.

**Database Tables:**
-   `owners`: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, `city`, `telephone`.
-   `pets`: `id`, `name`, `birth_date`, `type_id` (FK to `types`), `owner_id` (FK to `owners`).
-   `visits`: `id`, `pet_id` (FK to `pets`), `visit_date`, `description`.
-   `types`: `id`, `name`.

**Service Dependencies and Communication:**
-   `OwnerController`, `PetController`, `VisitController` all depend on `OwnerRepository` to fetch and persist data.
-   `PetController` also depends on `PetTypeRepository` to populate pet type dropdowns.
-   `PetTypeFormatter` is a Spring `Formatter` used by the MVC framework to bind `PetType` objects in web forms.

**Key Business Logic and Algorithms:**
-   **Owner Search**: `OwnerController` implements a paginated search for owners by last name.
-   **Pet Validation**: `PetValidator` contains custom validation logic for `Pet` entities (e.g., name is required, birth date is not in the future).
-   **Duplicate Pet Name Check**: `PetController` prevents an owner from having two pets with the same name.
-   **Data Integrity**: Data consistency is managed via JPA relationships and cascading operations (`CascadeType.ALL` on `Owner` -> `Pet` and `Pet` -> `Visit`), ensuring that when an owner is saved, their associated pets and visits are also saved.

#### 2.2 Component: Veterinarian Management (`vet` package)

This component handles information about veterinarians and their specialties. It is largely a read-only component from the UI perspective.

**Responsibilities:**
-   Listing all veterinarians and their specialties.
-   Providing veterinarian data in HTML, JSON, and XML formats.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**

| Class           | HTTP Method | Path          | Responsibility                                          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VetController` | `GET`       | `/vets.html`  | Display a list of all vets (HTML view).                 |
| `VetController` | `GET`       | `/vets`       | Return a list of all vets as JSON or XML (data endpoint). |

**Database Schemas and Data Models:**

-   **`Vet` (Entity)**: Extends `Person`. Represents a veterinarian.
    -   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`.
    -   Relationships: `@ManyToMany` with `Specialty` (eagerly fetched).
-   **`Specialty` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents a vet's area of expertise.
    -   Fields: `id`, `name`.
-   **`Vets` (Wrapper Class)**: A JAXB-annotated class used to wrap a list of `Vet` objects for XML/JSON serialization.

**Database Tables:**
-   `vets`: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`.
-   `specialties`: `id`, `name`.
-   `vet_specialties`: A join table with `vet_id` and `specialty_id` to manage the many-to-many relationship.

**Service Dependencies and Communication:**
-   `VetController` depends on `VetRepository` to fetch all vet data.
-   The `/vets` endpoint is cached.

**Key Business Logic and Algorithms:**
-   **Vet Listing with Caching**: The list of vets is cached to improve performance, as configured in `CacheConfiguration`. This suggests vet data is relatively static.

---

#### 2.3 Component: System & Cross-Cutting Concerns (`system` package)

This component contains shared configuration and controllers that are not tied to a specific business domain.

**Responsibilities:**
-   Application-wide configuration (caching, web settings).
-   Serving the welcome page.
-   Handling application errors.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**

| Class               | HTTP Method | Path   | Responsibility                            |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `WelcomeController` | `GET`       | `/`    | Display the application's home/welcome page. |
| `CrashController`   | `GET`       | `/oups`| Intentionally throws an exception for testing error handling. |

**Key Configuration:**
-   **`CacheConfiguration`**: Enables Spring's caching (`@EnableCaching`) and configures a JCache-compliant cache named `"vets"`. This directly impacts the `Vet` component.
-   **`WebConfiguration`**: Configures internationalization (i18n) by setting up a `SessionLocaleResolver` and a `LocaleChangeInterceptor`, allowing users to change the language via a `?lang=` URL parameter.
-   **`PetClinicRuntimeHints`**: Provides hints to the GraalVM AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiler for building a native image, specifying resources to include (e.g., `db/*`, `messages/*`).

### 3. Configuration and Deployment Details

**Configuration:**
-   **`application.properties`**: Contains the default configuration. Configures an in-memory H2 database, Thymeleaf settings, and server properties.
-   **`application-mysql.properties` / `application-postgres.properties`**: Provide database connection details for MySQL and PostgreSQL respectively. These are activated using Spring Profiles (`spring.profiles.active=mysql` or `postgres`).
-   **`messages/*.properties`**: Contains internationalization strings for various languages.

**Deployment:**
-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Provides a convenient way to run `mysql` and `postgres` database containers for local development. It maps local ports and sets up the necessary users and databases.
-   **Kubernetes (`k8s/` directory)**: Contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application and a PostgreSQL database.
    -   **`db.yml`**: Defines a `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Secret` for a PostgreSQL database.
    -   **`petclinic.yml`**: Defines a `Deployment` and `Service` (`NodePort` type) for the PetClinic application itself. It demonstrates how to connect to the database using service discovery and projected volumes for secrets, following service binding specifications. It also includes configuration for liveness and readiness probes (`/livez`, `/readyz`), which are enabled via the Actuator.
-   **Build Image**: The `README.md` and `pom.xml` indicate support for building a container image directly via the Spring Boot Maven plugin (`./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`), which uses Cloud Native Buildpacks. There is no explicit `Dockerfile`.
