### Comprehensive Architectural Summary: Spring PetClinic

This document consolidates architectural details from a full codebase analysis of the Spring PetClinic application, intended to support microservice decomposition efforts.

### 1. Overall Architecture Summary

The Spring PetClinic application is a **classic Layered Monolithic web application** built using the **Spring Boot** framework. All features are developed, packaged, and deployed as a single, self-contained unit. Its primary purpose is to model the business operations of a veterinary clinic, including managing owners, pets, visits, and veterinarians.

#### 1.1. Key Architectural Patterns & Frameworks

*   **Architectural Style**: A multi-layered monolithic architecture, with clear separation between the Web (Controller), Service (implicit in Repositories), and Data Access (Repository) layers.
*   **Design Patterns**:
    *   **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Spring MVC is used to separate web request handling, domain modeling, and view rendering.
    *   **Repository Pattern**: Spring Data JPA provides an abstraction over the data access layer.
    *   **Aggregate (Domain-Driven Design Concept)**: The `Owner` entity acts as an aggregate root for `Pet` and `Visit` entities. Modifications to pets and visits are managed through the `Owner` and persisted via the `OwnerRepository`, indicating a strong bounded context.
*   **Core Frameworks**:
    *   **Backend**: Spring Boot serves as the primary application framework.
    *   **Web Layer**: Spring MVC handles web requests for both UI and API endpoints.
    *   **Data Persistence**: Spring Data JPA with Hibernate as the ORM provider manages database interactions.
    *   **View Layer**: Thymeleaf is the server-side templating engine for rendering HTML.
    *   **Caching**: Spring Cache abstraction (`@Cacheable`) is used for caching database queries.

#### 1.2. Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Java 17 / 21
*   **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Font-Awesome
*   **Database**: In-memory H2 (default), with profile-based support for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
*   **Build System**: Apache Maven and Gradle are both supported.
*   **Data Serialization**: Native JSON support via Spring Boot (Jackson) and explicit XML support via JAXB annotations (`@XmlRootElement`).

#### 1.3. Communication Style

*   **Internal**: All communication between components is synchronous, intra-process Java method calls facilitated by Spring's Dependency Injection. There are no network calls between internal components.
*   **External**: The primary external dependency is a relational database, accessed via JDBC managed by Spring Data JPA.

### 2. Component Breakdown

The application is logically divided into three primary components based on its package structure and domain responsibilities: **Owner Management**, **Veterinarian Management**, and **System/Cross-Cutting Concerns**.

#### 2.1. Component: Owner Management (`owner` package)

This is the most complex component, handling all functionality related to pet owners, their pets, and medical visits. It represents the core business domain of the clinic.

**Responsibilities:**
*   Managing owner information (create, read, update, find).
*   Managing pet information associated with each owner.
*   Managing medical visit records for each pet.
*   Managing the master list of available pet types.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**

| Class             | HTTP Method | Path                                          | Responsibility                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `OwnerController` | `GET`       | `/owners/find`                                | Display owner search form.                     |
| `OwnerController` | `GET`       | `/owners`                                     | Process owner search by last name (paginated). |
| `OwnerController` | `GET`       | `/owners/new`                                 | Display new owner creation form.               |
| `OwnerController` | `POST`      | `/owners/new`                                 | Process creation of a new owner.               |
| `OwnerController` | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}`                           | Display details for a specific owner.          |
| `OwnerController` | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/edit`                      | Display owner update form.                     |
| `OwnerController` | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/edit`                      | Process owner update.                          |
| `PetController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`                  | Display new pet form for an owner.             |
| `PetController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/new`                  | Process creation of a new pet.                 |
| `PetController`   | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit`         | Display pet update form.                       |
| `PetController`   | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit`         | Process pet update.                            |
| `VisitController` | `GET`       | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`   | Display new visit form for a pet.              |
| `VisitController` | `POST`      | `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`   | Process creation of a new visit.               |

**Database Schemas and Data Models:**

*   **`Owner` (Entity)**: Extends `Person`. Represents a pet owner.
    *   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `address`, `city`, `telephone`.
    *   Relationships: `@OneToMany` with `Pet`. An `Owner` can have multiple `Pet`s.
*   **`Pet` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents an animal.
    *   Fields: `id`, `name`, `birthDate`.
    *   Relationships: `@ManyToOne` with `PetType`, `@OneToMany` with `Visit`, `@ManyToOne` with `Owner`.
*   **`PetType` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents pet categories (e.g., cat, dog).
    *   Fields: `id`, `name`.
    *   Relationships: `@OneToMany` with `Pet`.
*   **`Visit` (Entity)**: Extends `BaseEntity`. Represents a medical visit.
    *   Fields: `id`, `date`, `description`.
    *   Relationships: `@ManyToOne` with `Pet`.

**Database Tables:**
*   `owners`: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, `city`, `telephone`.
*   `pets`: `id`, `name`, `birth_date`, `type_id` (FK to `types`), `owner_id` (FK to `owners`).
*   `visits`: `id`, `pet_id` (FK to `pets`), `visit_date`, `description`.
*   `types`: `id`, `name`.

**Service Dependencies and Communication:**
*   Web controllers (`OwnerController`, `PetController`, `VisitController`) have a direct, compile-time dependency on `OwnerRepository`.
*   The logic for adding/updating a `Pet` or `Visit` is orchestrated through the `Owner` aggregate and persisted via `OwnerRepository`, indicating tight coupling between these entities.
*   `PetController` also depends on `PetTypeRepository` to populate UI dropdowns.

**Key Business Logic and Algorithms:**
*   **Owner Search**: Implements a paginated search for owners by last name (`findByLastNameStartingWith`).
*   **Data Validation**: Server-side validation is performed on form submissions (e.g., `PetValidator`, required visit description).
*   **Duplicate Pet Name Check**: Logic in `PetController` prevents an owner from having two pets with the same name.
*   **Data Integrity**: Data consistency is managed via JPA relationships and cascading operations (`CascadeType.ALL` on `Owner` -> `Pet` and `Pet` -> `Visit`), ensuring that saving an `Owner` also saves its associated pets and visits.

#### 2.2. Component: Veterinarian Management (`vet` package)

This component handles information about veterinarians and their specialties. It is largely a read-only component with a simpler data model.

**Responsibilities:**
*   Listing all veterinarians and their areas of specialty.
*   Providing veterinarian data in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, XML).

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**

| Class           | HTTP Method | Path          | Responsibility                                          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VetController` | `GET`       | `/vets.html`  | Display a paginated list of all vets (HTML view).       |
| `VetController` | `GET`       | `/vets`       | Return a list of all vets as JSON or XML (data endpoint). |

**Database Schemas and Data Models:**

*   **`Vet` (Entity)**: Extends `Person`. Represents a veterinarian.
    *   Fields: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`.
    *   Relationships: `@ManyToMany` with `Specialty` (`FetchType.EAGER`).
*   **`Specialty` (Entity)**: Extends `NamedEntity`. Represents a vet's area of expertise.
    *   Fields: `id`, `name`.
*   **`Vets` (Wrapper Class)**: A JAXB-annotated DTO used to wrap a `List<Vet>` for clean XML/JSON serialization (e.g., a root `<vets>` element).

**Database Tables:**
*   `vets`: `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`.
*   `specialties`: `id`, `name`.
*   `vet_specialties`: A join table with `vet_id` and `specialty_id` to manage the many-to-many relationship.

**Service Dependencies and Communication:**
*   `VetController` depends on `VetRepository` to fetch vet data.
*   There are no dependencies or communication between the Vet component and the Owner Management component.

**Key Business Logic and Algorithms:**
*   **Data Caching**: The `VetRepository`'s `findAll()` method is annotated with `@Cacheable("vets")`. This means the full list of veterinarians is cached after the first request, improving performance and reducing database load. This implies vet data is considered relatively static.
*   **Pagination**: The `/vets.html` endpoint implements pagination for the UI.
*   **Data Sorting**: The `getSpecialties()` method in the `Vet` entity sorts the specialties alphabetically by name before returning them.

---

#### 2.3. Component: System & Cross-Cutting Concerns (`system` package)

This component contains shared configuration, utility controllers, and functionality not tied to a specific business domain.

**Responsibilities:**
*   Serving the application's home page.
*   Handling application-wide errors.
*   Providing application-wide configuration (caching, web settings).
*   Demonstrating error handling for testing purposes.

**API Endpoints and Interfaces:**

| Class               | HTTP Method | Path   | Responsibility                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WelcomeController` | `GET`       | `/`    | Display the application's home/welcome page.                     |
| `CrashController`   | `GET`       | `/oups`| Intentionally throws an exception to test global error handling. |

**Key Configuration & Logic:**
*   **`CacheConfiguration`**: Enables Spring's caching (`@EnableCaching`) and configures a JCache-compliant cache named `"vets"`.
*   **`WebConfiguration`**: Configures internationalization (i18n) with a `LocaleChangeInterceptor`, allowing users to change language via a `?lang=` URL parameter.
*   **`PetClinicRuntimeHints`**: Provides hints for GraalVM Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation to build a native executable image.
*   **Global Error Handling**: The application has a custom, global error handling mechanism that renders a user-friendly HTML error page for UI requests and a structured JSON error response for API requests (`Accept: application/json`).

---

### 3. Configuration Details

*   **Application Configuration**:
    *   Uses profile-based `.properties` files (`application.properties`, `application-mysql.properties`, etc.) to manage settings.
    *   The active database profile (`h2`, `mysql`, `postgres`) can be selected via the `spring.profiles.active` property.
    *   Database connection details can be overridden by environment variables (e.g., `${MYSQL_URL}`).
*   **Database Initialization**:
    *   Schema creation (`schema.sql`) and data seeding (`data.sql`) are handled by Spring Boot's `spring.sql.init` mechanism.
    *   Scripts are idempotent (e.g., using `INSERT IGNORE` or `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
    *   JPA/Hibernate's `ddl-auto` is explicitly set to `none`, indicating that schema management is handled entirely by the SQL scripts, not the ORM.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**:
    *   Multi-language support is a core requirement.
    *   UI strings are externalized into `messages_*.properties` files for multiple languages.
    *   A custom test (`I18nPropertiesSyncTest`) acts as a quality gate to enforce i18n best practices, such as checking for hardcoded strings.
*   **Operational Endpoints**: All Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are exposed (`management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`), providing health checks, metrics, and other operational information.

---

### 4. Deployment, DevOps, and Testing

*   **Build System**: Supports both Maven (`mvnw`) and Gradle (`gradlew`).
*   **Development Environment**: A `.devcontainer` configuration is provided for a standardized, containerized development environment using VS Code Dev Containers or Gitpod, specifying Java version and required tools.
*   **Containerization**:
    *   A container image can be built directly using Cloud Native Buildpacks via the Spring Boot Maven plugin (`./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`). There is no explicit `Dockerfile`.
    *   A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to easily run dependent database containers (MySQL, PostgreSQL) for local development.
*   **Orchestration (Kubernetes)**:
    *   A `k8s/` directory contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application and a PostgreSQL database.
    *   Manifests define `Deployment`, `Service` (of type `NodePort`), and `Secret` resources, demonstrating a containerized deployment model.
    *   The application deployment includes liveness (`/livez`) and readiness (`/readyz`) probes, which are enabled via the Actuator.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**:
    *   Workflows automate building and testing the application on every push/pull request to the `main` branch.
    *   A deployment workflow (`deploy-and-test-cluster.yml`) defines a process to create a `kind` (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster and apply the `k8s/` manifests, confirming an automated deployment strategy.
*   **Testing Strategy**:
    *   **Unit Tests**: For isolated components (e.g., `CrashControllerTests`).
    *   **MVC Slice Tests (`@WebMvcTest`)**: Test the web controller layer in isolation with mocked service/repository dependencies (e.g., `VisitControllerTests`).
    *   **Data/JPA Slice Tests (`@DataJpaTest`)**: Test the persistence layer against a database (e.g., `ClinicServiceTests`).
    *   **Integration Tests (`@SpringBootTest`)**: Test the full application stack (e.g., `CrashControllerIntegrationTests`).
    *   **Database Integration Testing**: Uses **Testcontainers** to run integration tests against real MySQL and PostgreSQL databases in Docker.
    *   **Performance Tests**: A **JMeter** test plan (`petclinic_test_plan.jmx`) is included to simulate 500 concurrent users against key business workflows.
