### Proposed Microservice Architecture

    User -- "HTTP Requests" --> APIGateway

    APIGateway -- "Sync REST API Call <br/> (e.g., GET /owners)" --> CustomerService
    APIGateway -- "Sync REST API Call <br/> (e.g., GET /vets)" --> VetsService

### Rationale

This decomposition splits the monolith into three services based on the distinct bounded contexts of customer management and veterinarian reference data, with an API Gateway handling user-facing concerns. The behavioral analysis from the sequence diagrams directly informs the communication patterns: the "Finding an Owner" and "Adding a New Pet" scenarios depict synchronous, transactional workflows that are self-contained within the proposed **Customer Service**. In contrast, the "Viewing Veterinarians" scenario shows a read-heavy, cacheable data access pattern, justifying its isolation into a separate **Vets Service** that can be scaled and managed independently. Since the sequence diagrams reveal no direct interactions between the owner and veterinarian domains, a message bus is unnecessary; simple, synchronous REST calls from the **API Gateway** to the appropriate downstream service accurately model the required request-response communication.
